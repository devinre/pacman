WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2452 - The IOB rgb<4> is either not constrained (LOC) to
   a specific location and/or has an undefined I/O Standard (IOSTANDARD). This
   condition may seriously affect the device and will be an error in bitstream
   creation. It should be corrected by properly specifying the pin location and
   I/O Standard.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2452 - The IOB rgb<5> is either not constrained (LOC) to
   a specific location and/or has an undefined I/O Standard (IOSTANDARD). This
   condition may seriously affect the device and will be an error in bitstream
   creation. It should be corrected by properly specifying the pin location and
   I/O Standard.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2452 - The IOB rgb<6> is either not constrained (LOC) to
   a specific location and/or has an undefined I/O Standard (IOSTANDARD). This
   condition may seriously affect the device and will be an error in bitstream
   creation. It should be corrected by properly specifying the pin location and
   I/O Standard.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2452 - The IOB rgb<7> is either not constrained (LOC) to
   a specific location and/or has an undefined I/O Standard (IOSTANDARD). This
   condition may seriously affect the device and will be an error in bitstream
   creation. It should be corrected by properly specifying the pin location and
